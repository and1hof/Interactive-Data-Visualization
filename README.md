# Interactive-Medical-Records-Visualization
This is a multidimensional data visualization utilizing d3, dc and crossfilter libaries. Written in javascript and prettified in css. 

This library uses mock (procederally) generated data, so SSN's are all fake.
I did it to test out JavaScript as a data-visualization, and see how far it could be pushed (e.x. cross-sectioning data in real-time).

This is responsive (sub 30ms) provided the input data set is under ~1000 or so rows.
